# Documentation design

Read `../BRANDING.md` before changing the docs' visual identity. The user
approved the Casita companion logo from the Obrador repository, with the
Rust-orange Root House and lowercase wordmark. Reuse the
canonical SVGs in `public/brand/` and the shared `BrandLogo` component.

Preserve the existing Astro/Starlight and site-kit integration and the
Cloudflare Workers deployment flow. Validate changes with `npm run validate`
from this directory (or `devenv shell -- npm --prefix docs run validate`
from the repository root).
